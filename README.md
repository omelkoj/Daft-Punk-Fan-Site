# Project2

Julia,

I like how you used your divs to keep your sections clean and organized. I like the minimalist style of your page. You also nested well and had all elements lined up. your style is clean and had good differences to create a good looking page. You also laid your iframes out well. Good use of comments. It helped me to navigate through the code.
